# Dashboard

When selecting a project, the project dashboard is opened. The dashboard shows you the number of valid and spam submissions over time in a chart.

The gray line with the text **Statistic only** shows you to which date you can expect the submissions in the submission list. All submissions on the left side of this line have already been deleted.

## Date range selector _(Added in v1.1)_

You can choose the visible date range with the date range selector in the top right corner. The dropdown shows only the possible values, according to the setting **Statistic storage**. If you choose **3 months** in the setting, for example, only the options up to 3 months are visible in the dropdown in the dashboard.
