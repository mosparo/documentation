# Submissions

Under "Submissions", you will find all submissions that have not yet been deleted. Submissions will be automatically deleted after 14 days and will no longer be visible in the list of submissions.

With the dropdown in the top right corner, you can filter the list of submissions by their status. To see only submissions that contain spam or weren't correctly verified, use the option "Spam submissions". Use the option "Valid submissions" to see all correctly submitted submissions.

### Form data
The "Form data" box lists all form fields that have been or could be filled out in the form.

The name of the field is displayed for each form field. This is the technical name of a field and not necessarily the visual label of a field. In addition, it shows how many points a field has received and based on which rule.

You will also see a status indicator behind the name of a field. This status indicator shows whether the field in the verification was verified correctly by the backend, whether there was a problem with the verification, or whether the website's backend did not verify the field.

| Status indicator                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ![Field is valid](./assets/status_valid.jpg)                             | Indicates that the field has been verified and that the data has been submitted correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Field has points](./assets/status_points_en.jpg)                       | Indicates if this field contains spam and has therefore received points in the rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Field verification failed](./assets/status_verification_failed_en.jpg) | Indicates that the field verification was unsuccessful, for example, because the website's backend did not submit the data correctly.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![Field not verified](./assets/status_not_verified_en.jpg)               | Indicates that a field has not been verified by site backend verification. This means that the field can be changed and is rather uncertain. It is not necessarily bad because, for example, it is a not-so-important field that needs to be rechecked by the backend. |
| ![Honeypot field](./assets/status_honeypot.jpg)                          | Displayed if the field is the honeypot field. This field should always be empty. Otherwise, the submission is spam.                                                                                                                                                                              |
