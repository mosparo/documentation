# Docker

Docker is a software, which allows you to run already prepared images of software on your own server. The running Docker image on your server is called container. With the Docker image you do not have to upload files, configure web servers (except the reverse proxy) and do not have to take care about the PHP settings.

## Requirements

To use the Docker image, you need at least

- Docker version 20.10.20 or newer
- One MySQL or PostgreSQL database, in a Docker container or somewhere else

## Use the image

There are two options to use the Docker image. The first and recommended option is to use Docker Compose. With Docker Compose you can create all the needed containers with more or less one command. But you can also create your Docker container manually by using the image directly.

### Use Docker Compose

To use this method, please install Docker Compose first. You can find the manual here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Now you should create a new directory on your server. In this directory, please create a new file called `docker-compose.yaml`.

Insert the following content into this file:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    # We recommend the mariadb image
    image: mariadb:10.10
    # If you want to use MySQL, uncomment the following line (and comment the one above)
    #image: mysql:8.0.27
    command: '--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password'
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mosparo_root_pw
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=mosparo
      - MYSQL_USER=mosparo
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=mosparo_password
    expose:
      - 3306
      - 33060
  mosparo_web:
    image: mosparo/mosparo:latest
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:8080:80
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MOSPARO_ENABLE_WEBSERVER=1
      - MOSPARO_ENABLE_CRON=0
    volumes:
      - mosparo_data:/mosparo-data
  mosparo_cron:
    image: mosparo/mosparo:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MOSPARO_ENABLE_WEBSERVER=0
      - MOSPARO_ENABLE_CRON=1
    volumes:
      - mosparo_data:/mosparo-data
volumes:
  db_data:
  mosparo_data:
```

We recommend replacing the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` values with your unique passwords.

After you created the file with the content above, open a terminal. Navigate to your newly created directory and run the following command to create and start the containers:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You should see that the images get downloaded and the containers get created.

After some time, the work should be completed and the mosparo container created. The mosparo container is now installed.

You should be able to access mosparo when you enter `127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser.

Use the name of the MySQL or PostgreSQL Docker container as the host for the database connection. If you use the Docker Compose file as provided, the name of the MySQL container is `db`. Fill in the other values as defined in the Docker Compose file.

Because of security reasons, you should not make the port 8080 of the mosparo image publicly available. Instead, you have to set up a reverse proxy. For this, see [reverse proxy](../configure/reverse_proxy).

### Use the image directly

Instead of using the Docker Compose method, you can of course create the container directly with the image. For this run the following command:

```
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 -d mosparo/mosparo
```

The image will be downloaded and the container created. If you want to use a dockerized MySQL or PostgreSQL database, you have to link the mosparo container to this container.

```
docker run â€“link mysql-server -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 -d mosparo/mosparo
```

:::info
Please adjust the container name `mysql-server` to your setup.
:::

You should be able to access mosparo when you enter `127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser.

Use the name of the MySQL or PostgreSQL Docker container as the host for the database connection.

Because of security reasons, you should not make the port 8080 of the mosparo image publicly available. Instead, you have to set up a reverse proxy. For this, see [reverse proxy](../configure/reverse_proxy).

## Unprivileged image

We also prepare an unprivileged image with mosparo. The unprivileged image does not need the root user to start the container. It is compatible with the security context `restricted-v2` of OpenShift. The following table shows you the differences between the standard and the unprivileged version:

| Difference           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No cron jobs         | The image does not execute any cron jobs. This is because the cron software requires root to start correctly. The official recommendation for Kubernetes is to use [Kubernetes cronjobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/). |
| Choose functionality | In the unprivileged image, you can choose whether to run nginx, PHP, or both in the container. See the environment variables for more information.                                                                                                              |
| Exposed port         | This image exposes port 8080 for the web server compared to port 80 in the standard image.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Volumes              | The unprivileged image uses three different volumes to replace the different writable directories with writeable volumes without linking.                                                                                                                       |
| Configuration file   | The path to the configuration file is defined as an environment variable. The image expects a volume for `/mosparo-config` in which the configuration file is stored.                                                                                           |

### Use Docker Compose

Use the following Docker Compose configuration to use the unprivileged image:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    # We recommend the mariadb image
    image: mariadb:11.4
    # If you want to use MySQL, uncomment the following line (and comment the one above)
    #image: mysql:8.0.37
    command: '--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password'
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mosparo_root_pw
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=mosparo
      - MYSQL_USER=mosparo
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=mosparo_password
    expose:
      - 3306
      - 33060
  mosparo_web:
    image: mosparo/mosparo-unprivileged:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MOSPARO_RUN_NGINX=1
      - MOSPARO_RUN_PHP_FPM=1
      - MOSPARO_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/mosparo-config/env.mosparo.php
      #- MOSPARO_CLEANUP_GRACE_PERIOD_ENABLED=1
    volumes:
      - mosparo_config:/mosparo-config
      - mosparo_public_resources:/mosparo/public/resources
      - mosparo_var:/mosparo/var
volumes:
  db_data:
  mosparo_config:
  mosparo_public_resources:
  mosparo_var:
```

## Environment variables

mosparo stores the configuration of mosparo in a PHP file as if you install it normally, so you cannot set the configuration by using environment variables.

However, there are a few additional environment variables that you can use to influence the behavior of the Docker image. Learn more on the page about the [environment variables](../configure/environment_variables).

## Health check

The Docker image uses the Docker Healthcheck to verify the health of the Docker container. If the connection to the database is impossible or something else is wrong, the health check will detect this problem.
