# Kubernetes

You have at least the following two options if you want to install mosparo with Kubernetes.

## Helm

You can use the mosparo Helm chart to set up mosparo on your Kubernetes cluster.

You can find the cart here: [mosparo/helmchart on GitHub](https://github.com/mosparo/helmchart)

_The Helm chart was contributed by [unicode-it](https://github.com/unicode-it)._

## Kubero

If you're already using Kubero to manage your Kubernetes cluster, you can use the template in Kubero to set up mosparo on your Kubernetes cluster.

Find more information about Kubero here: [kubero.dev](https://www.kubero.dev/)
